# Afterchain — The Inheritance Layer of Web3

Afterchain is an active, proprietary cryptographic protocol for deterministic, jurisdiction-agnostic post-mortem execution of digital asset transfers.

It enables irreversible on-chain inheritance triggered exclusively by certified death events — without custodians, lawyers, inactivity assumptions, or human executors.

## Project Status

**Status:** Active private development  
**Distribution model:** Licensing-only (closed-core)  
**Last protocol update:** January 2026  

This repository represents the **public specification and reference layer** of the Afterchain protocol.

Production code, execution logic, and partner integrations are developed privately and released only under commercial or institutional license.

## What Afterchain Is

- A cryptographic execution layer for post-mortem asset transfer  
- Designed for exchanges, custodians, and Web3 infrastructure  
- Zero-custody by design  
- Deterministic and irreversible  
- Privacy-preserving through zero-knowledge proofs  

---

## What Afterchain Is Not

- Not an open-source protocol  
- Not a consumer wallet or application  
- Not a legal testament  
- Not a custodial or trust-based service  

---

## Core Building Blocks (Conceptual)

- **Death Verification Oracle (DVO)**  
  Cryptographically verifies certified death events via institutional PKI sources.

- **Transfer Vault (TV)**  
  Smart-contract container enforcing deterministic execution rules.

- **Zero-Knowledge Beneficiary Registry (BRM)**  
  Privacy-preserving heir resolution using zk-SNARKs, Merkle trees, and nullifiers.

- **Execution Engine**  
  Coordinates final, irreversible on-chain settlement.

The Afterchain protocol is protected under international patent application  
**PCT/IB2025/057151**.

This repository does **not** grant any license to implement, reproduce, or derive from the protocol.
